Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

### Before filing an issue

If you're just looking for help, you'll probably attract the most eyes if you post in [GIS Stackexchange](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=esri-leaflet,leaflet) or [GeoNete](https://geonet.esri.com/community/discussions-lobby).

### I want to contribute, how do i go about it?

In general, we enforce a [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for new contributions to this repository, both for members of the community at large, and for our core contributing team.

If you're new to forking, you can find a pretty excellent resource to get more familiar with the general steps [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

Feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/Esri/developer-support/issues/new) if you get stuck, we're happy to help.
