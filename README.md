# Welcome to Developer Support
=========================

This is a place to collaborate and support GIS developers working with Esri's developer libraries.

Resources for troubleshooting as well as proof of concept samples to support developers!
Much of the code contained here is samples created by Esri staff to help developers understand how to program against all aspects of Esri‚Äôs Location Platform ‚Äì desktop, mobile devices and for the web.  It‚Äôs a great place to copy and paste code you may need or search for lesser-known methods or classes to see how they are implemented.  Despite the name however, this repository is not intended as a place to replace community and paid support offered by Esri.  For community support, check out our [Esri‚Äôs GeoNet site](https://geonet.esri.com/welcome).  For paid support check out [http://support.esri.com](http://support.esri.com) or contact your regional distributor.

* The resulting zip archive will contain ALL samples for this repository.

* In Windows, before you unzip, you may need to unblock the archive.  Right-click the zip file, select **Properties**, then select **Unblock**.

* The general organization of the repository is:  **[Technology Platform]-[Language]/[Sample Name]**

* Many of the samples will require installation of supporting software (e.g. a respective SDK). See the sample readme for dependencies.

## Esri Staff

To get involved, you have two options:

1. if you currently work in tech support and prefer to get familiar with GitHub using the [fork and pull](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) model, you can contribute as much as you please (just like the rest of planet üåè) . some people like doing things this way because they know they can't do any harm when they don't have permission to push their own code upstream.

2. that said, we **do** want to encourage more folks to take on a maintainer role. so we highly recommend that you [<kbd>Request to join</kbd>](https://github.com/orgs/Esri/teams/apps-group/members) the [Support Services](https://github.com/orgs/Esri/teams/support-services) team to start upping your game and get _push_ access.

the only prerequisites are: 
* you have to be currently employed by Esri
* you must have already reviewed someone elses pull request or submitted one of your own (even if its just a simple typo fix).
